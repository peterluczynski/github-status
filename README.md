# GitHub status

## Why?
- Learn scraping information from a website with NPM Request package
- Learn processing that information later on

## All technologie
- Html
- Sass
- Javascript
- Npm (Browserify and Request)

## Usage
The website simply shows current status for GitHub. User can refresh it. If something is not in
an operational mode, it will be flagged with red color instead of green.
